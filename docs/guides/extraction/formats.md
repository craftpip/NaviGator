# Extractors

Choose how Navigator extracts and formats page content. The right extractor depends on what you need.

## Format Options

| `html_to_markdown` | Full page converted to markdown | Pages where Readability strips too much |

## `readability_to_markdown` — clean article text as markdown

Strips navigation, footers, sidebars, and ads; keeps headings and article structure.

## AI Model Extractors

If configured with `POST_PROCESSOR_MODELS`, you can use AI models to extract content. The page HTML is sent to an AI model, which returns clean markdown.

Available models appear in the format dropdown in the web console. They fall back to `html_to_markdown` if the model fails.

See [Post-processors (AI)](/guides/extraction/ai-extractors) for setup details.

## Tips

- **Start with the default** — `readability_to_markdown` works for most pages
- **Try `html_to_markdown`** if the default strips too much content
- **Use `table` formats** for data-heavy pages
- **Use `text`** when you just need a quick content grab
- **Check the web console** — the Domain Hints editor lets you test different formats

## Next Steps

- [Domain Hints](/guides/extraction/domain-hints) — Per-site extraction rules
