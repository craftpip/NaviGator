# Operations, Configuration, and State

## Docker Runtime

`docker-compose.yml` runs one `navigator` service. The repository is bind-mounted at `/app`, screenshots use `/tmp/screenshots:/app/screenshots`, and the Chrome profile is persisted in the `navigator_chrome_profile_data` volume.

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec navigator curl -s localhost:1994/health
```

The container entrypoint installs production dependencies at startup. Install development dependencies in the running container before linting or Vitest:

```bash
docker compose exec navigator npm install --include=dev
docker compose exec navigator npx vitest run
```

## Configuration Model

`loadConfig()` in `src/config.js` is the single environment-to-runtime mapping. `CONFIG_SCHEMA` provides the web-console editable subset. `config-manager.js` validates values and hot-applies supported settings; `env-file.js` changes only requested assignments so comments and unrelated `.env` contents are preserved.

| Area | Important settings |
|---|---|
| Browser | `BROWSER_BACKEND`, `DEVTOOLS_BROWSER_BACKEND`, `CHROME_PATH`, `CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR`, `CLOAKBROWSER_BINARY_PATH`, `LIGHTPANDA_PATH`, `HEADLESS`, `BROWSER_OP_TIMEOUT_MS`, `NAV_WAIT_UNTIL` |
| Transport | `ENABLE_HTTP_MCP`, `ENABLE_STDIO_MCP`, `MCP_API_PORT`, `MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED`, `MCP_API_KEYS`, `DISABLE_TOOLS` |
| Search | `SEARCH_ENABLED_ENGINES`, `SEARCH_ROUTE_WARMUP_ENGINES`, `SEARCH_ROUTE_CIRCUIT_OPEN_MS`, `SEARCH_QUEUE_*`, `ENABLE_INSTANT_ANSWERS`, search-window limits |
| Extraction | `DOMAIN_HINTS_PATH`, `WEB_FETCH_MAX_CHARS`, `POST_PROCESSOR_MODELS`, stabilization and non-content selector settings |
| Capacity | `MAX_CONCURRENT_PAGE_OPS`, `OPEN_PAGE_MAX_PARALLEL`, `HUMAN_TYPING_DELAY` |
| Screenshots | `ENABLE_SCREENSHOT_PATH`, `ENABLE_SCREENSHOT_DOWNLOAD_LINK` |
| Operations | `ENABLE_WEB_CONSOLE`, `ENABLE_VNC`, `ENABLE_DEVTOOLS_MCP`, `ENABLE_HTTP_HEALTH`, ports (`MCP_API_PORT`, `HEALTH_PORT`, `LIGHTPANDA_PORT`, `VNC_PORT`, `NOVNC_PORT`), `DEBUG`, `LOG_TOOL_ERRORS`, `ENABLE_HANG_RESTART`, `HANG_RESTART_TIMEOUT_MS` |

`HEADLESS=false` is forced back to headless unless `ENABLE_VNC=1`, because a graphical display is required for headful operation. Search routes select their registered backend independently of `BROWSER_BACKEND`.

## SQLite State

`initDb()` creates `data/navigator.db` by default. SQLite uses WAL mode, normal synchronization, and a five-second busy timeout. Activity older than seven days is pruned at startup and at most once per hour.

| Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| `searches` | Search query, variants, selected routes, status, duration, result count |
| `engine_attempts` | Per-route attempt, backend, result count, outcome, and timing |
| `page_ops` | Fetch, screenshot, and page operation telemetry |
| `activity_events` | Web and DevTools tool outcome timeline |
| `usage_totals` | Durable aggregate counter totals |
| `api_keys` | Named MCP secrets and JSON tool allow-lists |
| `ref_links` | Durable URL-to-numeric-reference mappings |
| `app_state`, `schema_version` | Migration and one-time initialization state |

Search IDs and page-operation IDs have independent sequences. Consumers of `/stats/activity` must therefore keep separate search and page-operation cursors.

## Activity and Health

`activity.js` records searches, engine attempts, page operations, and tool events. `searchContext` is an `AsyncLocalStorage` context that attaches route attempts to the search that created them. The status API supplies both recent incremental activity and zero-filled trends for several durations.

`/health` is the fast operational probe. `/stats` adds browser tabs, caches, usage totals, request rates, errors, engine route attempts, scheduler profiles, and activity. The host `navigator.js` CLI uses these endpoints:

```bash
./navigator.js statistics
./navigator.js monitoring --interval 2
./navigator.js engines
./navigator.js engines reset google_cb
```

The base URL is resolved from `--url`, then `NAVIGATOR_URL`, then `.env` `MCP_API_HOST` and `MCP_API_PORT`, then `http://localhost:1994`.

## Web Console

The React/Vite console lives in `src/web-console/` and is served at `/console` (`/ui` and `/dashboard` are aliases). Build it on the host:

```bash
npm run console:build
```

It provides:

- Status dashboard: browser instances, target timers, route health, request trends, activity, and errors.
- Configuration management: current/effective values, hot versus recreate-required changes, backups, reset, and revert.
- MCP tool runner: dynamically generated forms from tool schemas.
- API key management: creation, revocation, and tool allow-lists.
- Domain hint editor: list, validate, test a candidate page extraction, create, update, and delete rules.
- Remote Desktop controls: enable the VNC/noVNC stack, then open or close it from one grouped control.

## Error Logging

`logToolError()` appends redacted JSON lines to `logs/tool-errors.log` when `LOG_TOOL_ERRORS=1`. The log rotates near 5 MB to `.1`. Keys resembling passwords, tokens, secrets, authorization, API keys, or cookies are masked; typed input is retained only as a character count.

`DEBUG=1` enables per-step fetch timing logs. These are operational diagnostics and intentionally remain in server source.

## VNC/noVNC

`VncManager` runs or adopts the optional graphical stack: Xvfb, fluxbox, x11vnc, and websockify/noVNC. Enabling VNC sets `DISPLAY=:99`, starts the stack, relaunches the default browser headfully, and persists `ENABLE_VNC=1` plus `HEADLESS=false`. Disabling reverses that sequence and returns to headless mode.

The manager records lifecycle steps, checks readiness, reuses existing scoped processes, and terminates owned/adopted processes on stop. Default desktop resolution is 1920x1080x24; noVNC is normally available on port 1996.
